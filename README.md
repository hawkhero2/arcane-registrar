## Arcane Registrar
##### Multiplatform account creation script

Currently it makes use of SSH connection to connect to the target servers/machines to create the provided user(will add functionality to batch creaate users from given file, maybe)

The logging is done with a python lib and kind of messy for the moment, will improve in future.

It currently works for:
- LDAP Server
- Windows Server
